# NAND to Tetris Projects

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions and resources for the NAND to Tetris project, a comprehensive journey to build a modern computer system "from scratch." The projects cover various aspects of computer architecture, starting from basic logic gates all the way to a simple operating system.

## Getting Started

To get started with the NAND to Tetris projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nand-to-tetris.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:

  cd nand2tetris

## Project List

1. Project 1: Boolean Logic: Implement basic logic gates and build more complex circuits.
2. Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic: Design an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and build an adder.
3. Project 3: Sequential Logic: Construct flip-flops and memory units for sequential circuits.
4. Project 4: Machine Language: Implement an assembler for the Hack machine language.
5. Project 5: Computer Architecture: Design a CPU architecture and implement the Hack computer.
6. Project 6: Assembler: Write an assembler program to translate assembly code into machine code.
7. Project 7: Virtual Machine I: Implement a virtual machine translator (VM translator) for the Hack computer.
8. Project 8: Virtual Machine II: Extend the VM translator to support additional commands and functionalities.
9. Project 9: Implement High Level Jack language to make fun game like PingPong.
10. Project 10: High-Level Language I: Design and implement a Jack compiler (part I).
